##Team 13 Voting System Project

This repo contains the Voting System Project done by Team 13.

### Branching Model

To compile the file open a terminal and make sure that you are inside the project folder
```
umn-csci-5801-S18/repo-Team13/project_1
```
Then, you can simply type the following in a Terminal:
```
make all
```
This will create all files which include an executable file **elect.out** and all the test files.

To launch the Voting System, type in:
```
./elect.output
```
You will then be prompted to type in the number of candidates in the election, the number of seats, ballots, the voting type to run the election on and the name of the CSV file that contains all the ballots.
