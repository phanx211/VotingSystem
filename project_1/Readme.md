### Branching Model

To compile the file open a terminal and make sure that you are inside the project folder
```
umn-csci-5801-S18/repo-Team13/project_1

Then, you can simply type the following in a Terminal:
```

```
This will create all files which include an executable file **elect.out** and all the test files.
