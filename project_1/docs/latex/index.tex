VS is a voting system designed to implement both plurality voting as well as single transferable voting (\mbox{\hyperlink{class_s_t_v}{S\+TV}}) methods. \mbox{\hyperlink{class_election}{Election}} holders are able to select the parameters of the election (ie. number of candidates, number of available seats, and number of ballots cast) as well as the desired voting method. The system will then assign winners to the available seats.
