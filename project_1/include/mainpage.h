 * VS is a voting system designed to implement both plurality voting as well as
 * single transferable voting (STV) methods. Election holders are able to
 * select the parameters of the election (ie. number of candidates, number of
 * available seats, and number of ballots cast) as well as the desired voting
 * method. The system will then assign winners to the available seats.
